// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or vendor/assets/javascripts of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
// *** NOTE FROM THE 250 INSTRUCTORS ***
// *** The asset pipeline for Javascript is effectively disabled down below because of a current lack of compatibility with Windows 8.
// **** Soliloquy doesn't really use Javascript anyway, but if you want to play, just remove the phrase "removemebeforequals" below. e.g. //= require blah
//removemebeforeequals= require jquery
//removemebeforeequals= require jquery_ujs
//removemebeforeequals= require turbolinks
//removemebeforeequals= require_tree .
